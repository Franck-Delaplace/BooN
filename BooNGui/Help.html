    <p> The graphical interface enables the creation and analysis of Boolean networks, called <b>BooN</b>, through two classes of methods: file and network.
        The file methods manage files containing networks, while the network methods analyze the network.
        The network methods are also available in the toolbar on the left side of the window.
        The last help menu also includes basic utilities.

    <h2 id="design"> Design network</h2>
    <p > The network is designed interactively.
        At the bottom of the graph window, there is a <i>pattern network</i>  which is used to
        select the edge sign: either positive (<span style="color: Green;">Green</span>) or negative (<span style="color:red">Red</span>).&nbsp;
        If the interaction is not monotone, its definition will be achieved by modifying the formula directly.
        This network will never be included in the final BooN. When you select the appropriate edge by clicking on it in this network, all new edges will be of the same type as this edge.
        The selected node or edge is always emphasized. <br>
        The network design commands are: </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Create a node:</b></dt><dd>press <span class="cmd">[insert]</span> or
            <span class="cmd">+</span> will add a new node to the
            graph at mouse position.</dd>
         <dt><b>Create an edge:</b></dt><dd>to create a new edge, first select an edge
            with the desired sign or color, then double-click the starting node and
            double-click the destination node next.</dd>
        <dt><b>Delete a node or edge:</b> </dt><dd>select the node or edge and press <span class="cmd">[delete]</span>
            or <span class="cmd">-</span>.</dd>
        <dt><b>Change edge direction:</b></dt><dd> pressing <span class="cmd">[@]</span>
            will reverse the direction of the selected edge.</dd>
        <dt><b>Label node or edge:</b></dt><dd>click on the node or edge, press <span class="cmd">[enter]</span>
            , next type the label, and press <span class="cmd">[enter]</span> again. A label must follow the
syntax of a variable.</dd>
    </dl>

<p class="info">
    <span class="info-title">INFO</span>
    <ul class="info">
		<li>The network design is based on
        <code>EditableGraph</code>  function of <code>Netgraph</code> Python module. Please refer to the
        documentation of this function for the commands related to the graph design. </li>

        <li> To prevent the GUI from becoming unresponsive, press <span class="cmd">[enter]</span>
		   a second time to complete the labeling process. If forgotten press again <span class="cmd">[enter]</span> to end the labeling.
        </li>
        <li> Nodes will only be integrated if they are named, so labeling a node is necessary to include it in the BooN.
        </li>
        <li> Edge labels correspond to module ID and must be integers, otherwise they are not considered.
            A module is a set of co-expressed genes. The variables having the same module ID belong to the same clause for formula in DNF.
        <li> For negative interactions, the labels are assumed to be negative (e.g., -1, -2) and for positive interactions, the labels are assumed to be positive (e.g., 1, 2).
           However, if the sign of a label does not match the interaction sign, the label sign is automatically corrected appropriatly. </li>
        <li> If a variable occurs in several modules, separate the integer label of each module by a space.</li>
        <li>  If no labels is set for an edge, then the source node is implicitly
            included in the first module (ID = 1). </li>
        <li> The default formula for a newly created node is False when it is isolated. </li>
		<li> It is also possible to create a network by directly writing the formula of a node in the <b>BooN View</b> window
            (See <span class="cmd">[View BooN]</span> in <a href="#analysis"> Boolean Network Analysis </a> section).

    <h3>Syntax of the imported text BooN file</h3>

    <p> The grammar of an equation is :<span class="cmd"> &lt;variable&gt; '=' &lt;formula&gt;</span>. For example, we have:<br>

    <p class="info">
        <b><span class="info-title">INFO:</span></b><br>
        The model of dynamics is exponential and thus this computation is reduced to a given number of variables. <br>
		The syntax of a new formula typed in the formula field must follow the SYMPY/Python syntax whatever the current output style, 
		and only use the already drawn nodes. Switching to Python style first is advisable to make these changes.
    </p>
	 <h2 id="controllability"> Controllability analysis </h2>
	 <p style="text-align: justify;"> Controllability analysis determines the variables that must be fixed/frozen to achieve a specific goal.
	 The goal is either to reach or avoid a Boolean profile of variables as markers at steady-state.
	The markers are purposely selected variables.
	 The procedure is decomposed into the following steps:
	 </p>
	 <dl>
	 <dt><b>Define marker profile:</b> </dt> <dd>
         On the left-hand side table, in the <span class="cmd"> Destiny</span> sheet,
         select the destiny profile by choosing the Boolean value of markers.
         </dd>
	 <dt><b>Observers characterization:</b> </dt>  <dd> The observers are variables that cannot be controlled by definition. 
         Set the observers in the <span class="cmd">Observers</span> sheet.
         The markers are always observers and implicitly set when their values are fixed.
	 </dd>
	 <dt><b>Choose the nature of the objective:</b> </dt> <dd> Choose either to <span class="cmd">[Reach]</span> or <span class="cmd">[Avoid]</span> the marking.
         <span class="cmd">[Reach]</span> implies that the marking will be reached at stable state while  <span class="cmd">
             [Avoid]</span> means that the marking will be avoided.
	 <dt> 
	 <dt><b>Determine the modality of the objective:</b></dt> <dd> There are two modalities: the <span class="cmd">[Possibility]</span>and the <span class="cmd">[Necessity]</span>.
	 In the case of a marking profile to be reached, the possibility implies that this marking profile exists for at least one stable state.
	 The necessity dictates that all stable states possess this profile.
	 The same applies to avoidance.
	  <dt><b>Find the possible control:</b></dt> <dd> Click on the control button to compute the different possible solutions which are displayed at right.  
	 <dt><b>Apply the control:</b></dt> <dd> 
	 Select one control solution and click on the rightmost button to apply it to the BooN.
         The BooN will be changed according to the solution by freezing the appropriate variables.
         Next the controllability analysis window will close.</dd>
    <dt> <b>Trace:</b></dt><dd> the trace of execution of the controllability
    is displayed in the console if it is checked (Default checked). </dd>
     </dl>
    <p class="info"><span class="info-title">INFO:</span><br>
      For profile avoidance, the necessity alone could generate solutions without stable states.
	 To impose a solution with a stable state, select both <span class="cmd">[Possibility]</span>and <span class="cmd">[Necessity]</span>.
