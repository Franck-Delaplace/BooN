    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The
        graphical interface allows the creation and the analysis of Boolean networks called <b>BooN</b>
        through two classes of methods: file and network. The file methods manage
        files containing networks, while the network methods analyze the
        network. The network methods are also available in the tool bar at left
        hand side of the window. The last Help menu includes: <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Undo]</span>, <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Redo]</span> and <span
                style="color: #ff9966;">[Help]</span> functionalities.</p>


    <h2 id="design"> Design network</h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The
        network is designed interactively.
        At the bottom of the graph window, there is a pattern network  which is used to
        select the edge style, either positive (<span style="color: Green;">Green</span>) or negative (<span style="color:red">Red</span>).&nbsp;
        This network will never be included in the final BooN. Click on the appropriate edge in this network and all new edges will be of the same type as this edge.
        The selected node or edge is always emphasized. <br>
        The network design commands are: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Create a node</b>: press <span style="color: #ff9966;">[insert]</span> or
            <span style="color: #ff9966;">+</span> will add a new node to the
            graph at mouse position.
        </li>
        <li><b>Create an edge</b>: To create and style a new edge, first select an edge
            with the desired sign or color, then double-click the starting node.
            Double-click the destination node next.
        </li>
        <li><b>Delete a node or edge:</b> select the node or edge and press <span style="color: #ff9966;">[delete]</span>
            or <span style="color: #ff9966;">-</span>.
        </li>
        <li><b>Change edge direction:</b> pressing<span style="color: #3366ff;"> <span style="color: #ff9966;">[@]</span></span>
            will reverse the direction of the selected edge.</span></li>
        <li><b>Label node or edge :</b>
            select the node or edge, press <span style="color: #ff9966;">[enter]</span>
            , type the label, and press [enter] again. A label must follow the
            syntax of a variable.<br>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
        <b><span style="color: red;">INFO</span></b>
    <ul style="background-color: #eeeeee;">
		<li>The nework desing is based on
        <span style="font-family: Consolas;"> EditableGraph </span> function of <span style="font-family: Consolas;"> Netgraph</span> module. Please refer to the
        documentation of this function for the commands related to the graph design. </li>
        <li> To prevent the GUI from becoming unresponsive, remember to press <span style="color: #ff9966;">[enter]</span> 
		   a second time to complete the labeling process. If forgotten, select the node or the edge where the label was
            modified again and press <span style="color: #ff9966;">[enter]</span> to end the labeling.
        </li>
        <li> Nodes will only be integrated if they are named, so label a node is necessary to include it in the BooN.
        </li>
        <li> Edge labels correspond to module ID and must be integers, otherwise they are not considered.
            If a variable occurs in several modules, separate the integer label of each module by a space.
            If no labels is set for an edge, then the source node is implicitly
            included in the first module (ID = 1).
        </li>
        <li> The default formula for a newly created node is False when it is isolated. </li>
		<li> It is also possible to create a network by directly specifying the formula related to a node (See View).
        <br>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 id="file"> File Menu </h2>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">You can load, save a BooN and import or export it. The exportation or importation is defined from a text file specification of a BooN.
	The extension of a BooN file is <span style="font-family: Consolas;">.boon</span> and it is
        accessible by<span style="color: #ff9966;"> [Load]</span> and <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Save]</span>.
        A text file specifying a Boolean network can be imported<span style="color: #ff9966;">
          [Import]</span> or exported <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Export]</span>
        with <span style="font-family: Consolas;">.txt</span> as default extension.
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #eeeeee;" style="text-align: justify;"><b style="color: red;">INFO:</b><br>
        The coordinates of the nodes are lost during the exportation, to keep them save the BooN before.
    </p>
    <h3>Syntax of the imported text
        BooN file</h3>
    <p> The file contains a set of
        equation where a Boolean equations must be written in the same
        line.&nbsp; Comments can be added and must start by&nbsp; #.&nbsp; The
        formula must follow the <a href="https://www.sympy.org/fr/" title="Sympy Documentation">Sympy</a>
        syntax, namely: (AND = &amp;, OR = |, NOT = ~).
    <p> The grammar of an equation is :<span style="color: #ff9966;"> &lt;variable&gt; '=' &lt;formula&gt;</span>. For example, we have:<br>
        </span></p>
    <p style="background-color: #eeeeee; text-align:left"><b><span style="color: red;">EXAMPLE:</span></b><br>
        <span style="font-family: Consolas;"># Example of BooN<br>
          x = (~x &amp; y) | z <br>
          y = ~z | x <br>
          z = y &amp; x &amp; ~z </span></p>
    <h2 id="analysis"> Boolean Network Analysis </h2>
    The different items are:
    <ul>
        <li><span style="color: #ff9966;">[View BooN]</span> shows the Boolean network specification corresponding to the current BooN.
            conversion to DNF is available via this functionality. 
			Moreover, the formulas can be redefined by typing a new formula in the formula field of a variable.
        </li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff9966;">[Stable states]</span> compute the stable states of the BooN. The method is based on SAT Solver and can be applied to large network.
        </li>
        <li><span style="color: #ff9966;">[Controllability]</span> perform a controllabillity analysis to determine which variables must be frozen to reach the expected goal
            identified by a variable marking.
        <li><span style="color: #ff9966;">[Model and Equilibria]</span>
            Compute the dynamics following the asynchronous or synchronous mode. In asynchronous mode, only one variable is updated per transition, whereas in synchronous mode,
            all variables are updated jointly. We suggest you switch to Python style first to make these changes
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="background-color: #eeeeee;" style="text-align: justify;">
        <b><span style="color: red;">INFO:</span></b><br>
        The model of dynamics is exponential and thus this computation is reduced to a given number of variables. <br>
		The syntax of a new formula typed in the formula field must follow the SYMPY/Python syntax whatever the current output style, 
		and only use the already drawn nodes. Switching to Python style first is advisable to make these changes.
    </p>
	 <h2 id="controllability"> Controllability analysis </h2>
	 <p style="text-align: justify;"> Controllability analysis determines the variables that must be fixed to achieve a specific goal. 
	 The goal is either to reach or avoid a Boolean profile of variables as markers at steady-state.
	The markers are purposely selected variables.
	 The procedure is decomposed into the following steps:
	 </p>
	 <dl>
	 <dt><b>Define marker profile:</b> </dt> <dd>
	 On the left-hand side table, select the destination profile by selecting value of markers. On the left-hand side table, 
	 select the destination profile by setting the markers to true or false.</dd>
	 <dt><b>Observers characterization:</b> </dt>  <dd> The observers are variables that cannot be controlled by definition. 
	 Set the observers in the second tab. The markers are always observers.
	 </dd>
	 <dt><b>Choose the nature of the objective:</b> </dt> <dd> Choose either to <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Reach]</span> or <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Avoid]</span> the marking.
	 <dt> 
	 <dt><b>Determine the modality of the objective</b></dt> <dd> There are two modalities: <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Possibility]</span>and <span style="color: #ff9966;">[Necessity]</span>.
	 In the case of a marking profile to reach, possibility implies the existence of this marking profile in a stable state at least.
	 Necessity dictates that all stable states possess this profile.
	 The same applies to avoidance. However, for avoidance, necessity alone can generate solutions without stable states. 
	 To achieve a stable state solution, it is necessary to consider both possibility and necessity.
	  <dt><b>Find the possible control:</b></dt> <dd> Click on the control button to compute the different possible solutions which are displayed at right.  
	 <dt><b>Apply the control:</b></dt> <dd> 
	 Select one control solution and click on the rightmost button to apply it to the BooN. The BooN will be modified, and the controllability analysis window will close.</dd>
